# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 2018 January 4, Thursday

##### Premise: I started studying coding a few months ago, but I really never established a discipline. In November 2017 I passed the first selection for the Google/Udacity Scholarship for Front-End Development, and I'm currently busy trying to adding extra functionalities to my final project. I'm also studying Python (Udemy, Codeacademy, SoloLearn), and I will keep track of it as well. 

**Today's Progress**: I'm still working on my Pixel Art Maker project. In a brief, the user can select the grid size, pick a color and draw in the grid cells. 
I've created a button which toggle the music on/off. I styled the buttons and created a transition effect on button hover.

**Thoughts:** I'm pretty satisfied of the result so far, visually at least, considering the fact that I started this completely new journey only in October 2017. At the moment I'm struggling with the implementation of a JavaScript functionality which should allow the user to erase the color from the grid cells just by right-clicking on it. As I'm getting gradually more confident with jQuery, I will probably use it to add the function.

### Day 1: 2018 January 5, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've styled the Pixel Art Maker and I introduced some small features. In a brief: 
- I've changed the background-color of the canvas and I've used a lighter color for the cells, with the result of having a better contrast with the background image;
- I've added a loop attribute for my audio/music element: now the music will keep on playing until the user decides to stop it by pressing the toggle music on/off button.

**Thoughts**: I want to create a function which limits the grid size so as to avoid a browser crash. I think that a conditional might serve the purpose. i plan to dive deep into the documentation once again.

### Day 2: 2018 January 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've resumed the JavaScript course on FreeCodeCamp, and I've learnt quite a few things. Now I know the difference between global and local variables, and I practiced them both in different scenarios. 

**Thoughts:** I'm currently engaged on different e-learning platforms: Udacity, Udemy, FreeCodeCamp, SoloLearn and W3Schools. I plan to resume studying Python intensively as soon as I feel confident enough with JavaScript. My method is to create a small program or a document and put what I studied into practice as soon as possible. 

### Day 3: 2018 January 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: After a brief break, I resumed diving into JavaScript. I started the online course "Watch and Code", which was recommended to me by some fellow students. The course comes revolves about the building of a real application (an interactive "To Do List"), and it comes with many practical examples. 

**Thoughts:** In order to advance fast enough I'm gonna continue with the courses I'm currently following and implement what I learn asap. Next step will be the completion of a portfolio webpage, which could also prove useful in the future. 

### Day 4: 2018 January 11, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I went on with the "Watch and Code" course (I'm at a 15% completion now), and I've reviewed some basic JS concepts such as function, scope atc.

**Thoughts:** I will study how to make my portfolio page, using all the languages I've been studying so far.

### Day 5: 2018 January 12, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I took a detour from the Pixel Art Maker Project and I resumed some Front-End Development course. I created a content slider with a vertical menu and a few slides. I plan to play around with the code to add some extra functionalities.

**Thoughts:** I feel that refreshing HTML, CSS and JS is mandatory at this point.

### Day 6: 2018 January 13, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I started a course on Udemy about Web Development which covers basically everything. HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, MongoDB, YelpCamp, etc. 

**Thoughts:** It feels good to refresh some basic stuff at this point. For instance, I didn't remember how to write forms for visually impaired people (<label for><input id>). I will keep on going and start some cool projects asap.

### Day 7: 2018 January 14, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've deepened my knowledge about CSS selectors and pseudo-classes. I Found this [article](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize--net-16048) extremely useful. 

**Thoughts:** I plan to create a few websites using pure CSS AND with some JS for practicing as much as possible.

### Day 8: 2018 January 28, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: After a long break due to some personal issues, I've finally resumed my journey. 
Today I completed the last CSS3 course I signed up for, and I'm now moving to the Bootstrap section. 

**Thoughts:** I plan to build a blog (landing page, navbar and menus), an interactive dictionary using Python and a responsive video gallery.
