# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 2018 January 4, Thursday

##### Premise: I started studying coding a few months ago, but I really never established a discipline. In November 2017 I passed the first selection for the Google/Udacity Scholarship for Front-End Development, and I'm currently busy trying to adding extra functionalities to my final project. I'm also studying Python (Udemy, Codeacademy, SoloLearn), and I will keep track of it as well. 

**Today's Progress**: I'm still working on my Pixel Art Maker project. In a brief, the user can select the grid size, pick a color and draw in the grid cells. 
I've created a button which toggle the music on/off. I styled the buttons and created a transition effect on button hover.

**Thoughts:** I'm pretty satisfied of the result so far, visually at least, considering the fact that I started this completely new journey only in October 2017. At the moment I'm struggling with the implementation of a JavaScript functionality which should allow the user to erase the color from the grid cells just by right-clicking on it. As I'm getting gradually more confident with jQuery, I will probably use it to add the function.

### Day 1: 2018 January 5, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've styled the Pixel Art Maker and I introduced some small features. In a brief: 
- I've changed the background-color of the canvas and I've used a lighter color for the cells, with the result of having a better contrast with the background image;
- I've added a loop attribute for my audio/music element: now the music will keep on playing until the user decides to stop it by pressing the toggle music on/off button.

**Thoughts**: I want to create a function which limits the grid size so as to avoid a browser crash. I think that a conditional might serve the purpose. i plan to dive deep into the documentation once again.

### Day 2: 2018 January 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've resumed the JavaScript course on FreeCodeCamp, and I've learnt quite a few things. Now I know the difference between global and local variables, and I practiced them both in different scenarios. 

**Thoughts:** I'm currently engaged on different e-learning platforms: Udacity, Udemy, FreeCodeCamp, SoloLearn and W3Schools. I plan to resume studying Python intensively as soon as I feel confident enough with JavaScript. My method is to create a small program or a document and put what I studied into practice as soon as possible.
