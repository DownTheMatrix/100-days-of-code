# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 2018 January 4, Thursday

##### Premise: I started studying coding a few months ago, but I really never established a discipline. In November 2017 I passed the first selection for the Google/Udacity Scholarship for Front-End Development, and I'm currently busy trying to adding extra functionalities to my final project. I'm also studying Python (Udemy, Codeacademy, SoloLearn), and I will keep track of it as well. 

**Today's Progress**: I'm still working on my Pixel Art Maker project. In a brief, the user can select the grid size, pick a color and draw in the grid cells. 
I've created a button which toggle the music on/off. I styled the buttons and created a transition effect on button hover.

**Thoughts:** I'm pretty satisfied of the result so far, visually at least, considering the fact that I started this completely new journey only in October 2017. At the moment I'm struggling with the implementation of a JavaScript functionality which should allow the user to erase the color from the grid cells just by right-clicking on it. As I'm getting gradually more confident with jQuery, I will probably use it to add the function.

### Day 1: 2018 January 5, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've styled the Pixel Art Maker and I introduced some small features. In a brief: 
- I've changed the background-color of the canvas and I've used a lighter color for the cells, with the result of having a better contrast with the background image;
- I've added a loop attribute for my audio/music element: now the music will keep on playing until the user decides to stop it by pressing the toggle music on/off button.

**Thoughts**: I want to create a function which limits the grid size so as to avoid a browser crash. I think that a conditional might serve the purpose. i plan to dive deep into the documentation once again.

### Day 2: 2018 January 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've resumed the JavaScript course on FreeCodeCamp, and I've learnt quite a few things. Now I know the difference between global and local variables, and I practiced them both in different scenarios. 

**Thoughts:** I'm currently engaged on different e-learning platforms: Udacity, Udemy, FreeCodeCamp, SoloLearn and W3Schools. I plan to resume studying Python intensively as soon as I feel confident enough with JavaScript. My method is to create a small program or a document and put what I studied into practice as soon as possible. 

### Day 3: 2018 January 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: After a brief break, I resumed diving into JavaScript. I started the online course "Watch and Code", which was recommended to me by some fellow students. The course comes revolves about the building of a real application (an interactive "To Do List"), and it comes with many practical examples. 

**Thoughts:** In order to advance fast enough I'm gonna continue with the courses I'm currently following and implement what I learn asap. Next step will be the completion of a portfolio webpage, which could also prove useful in the future. 

### Day 4: 2018 January 11, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I went on with the "Watch and Code" course (I'm at a 15% completion now), and I've reviewed some basic JS concepts such as function, scope atc.

**Thoughts:** I will study how to make my portfolio page, using all the languages I've been studying so far.

### Day 5: 2018 January 12, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I took a detour from the Pixel Art Maker Project and I resumed some Front-End Development course. I created a content slider with a vertical menu and a few slides. I plan to play around with the code to add some extra functionalities.

**Thoughts:** I feel that refreshing HTML, CSS and JS is mandatory at this point.

### Day 6: 2018 January 13, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I started a course on Udemy about Web Development which covers basically everything. HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, MongoDB, YelpCamp, etc. 

**Thoughts:** It feels good to refresh some basic stuff at this point. For instance, I didn't remember how to write forms for visually impaired people (<label for><input id>). I will keep on going and start some cool projects asap.

### Day 7: 2018 January 14, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've deepened my knowledge about CSS selectors and pseudo-classes. I Found this [article](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize--net-16048) extremely useful. 

**Thoughts:** I plan to create a few websites using pure CSS AND with some JS for practicing as much as possible.

### Day 8: 2018 January 28, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: After a long break due to some personal issues, I've finally resumed my journey. 
Today I completed the last CSS3 course I signed up for, and I'm now moving to the Bootstrap section. 

**Thoughts:** I plan to build a blog (landing page, navbar and menus), an interactive dictionary using Python and a responsive video gallery. 

### Day 9: 2018 January 31, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I went through 3 courses on Codeacademy, and I completed them: 1. Learn Bootstrap, 2. Learn Command Line.

**Thoughts:** Learning Bootstrap surely speeds up everything when it comes to build a website. However, at this stage I still prefer to keep on building pages from a scratch. The more the practice, the better. I save the shortcuts for later.

### Day 10: 2018 February 1, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I finally startec working on my Portfolio Page, where I will make sure to use all the basic skills I've been studying so far (I will include some Bootstrap classes as well). Today I've wrote down the layout using pen&paper, and tomorrow I will start building the page section by section.

**Thoughts:** I'm currently studying how to divide a website just by looking at it. <Header>, <section> (<article> and <aside>) and <footer>. I plan to become effectively capable of assessing a website structure as fast as possible. 
  
### Day 11: 2018 February 2, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I studied the Bootstrap grid system, what it is, how it works, what are the 4 different sizes, how to nest rows.

**Thoughts:** I'm about to start an Image Gallery project using Boostrap. I'm also studying the code of different successfully websites to quickly assess their structure.  

### Day 12: 2018 February 3, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I kept on practicing with Bootstrap, and I created a couple of pages: an [Image Gallery](https://codepen.io/BrandNew_12/pen/xYZxdm) and a [Landing Page](https://codepen.io/BrandNew_12/pen/payzQy) for a fictitious company. In both projects I played around with icons and gliphycons. 

**Thoughts:** I'm starting to see how it works now, all I need is just... a lot of more practice!

### Day 13: 2018 February 4, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I spent the afternoon facing some coding challenges. I tried Codewars, Coderbyte and Hackerrank, just to get some ideas of what to expect. I must admit I found even the most basic ones kinda hard, which means that I'd better practice more and more.

**Thoughts:** I'm gonna continue with the courses and, at the same time, I'm gonna build some easy applications to test my knowledge step by step. Stay tuned!

### Day 14: 2018 February 5, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Continuining with the JS course on Udemy, now currently busy with the control flow. I solved more than 10 problem sets about while and for loops.

**Thoughts:** This is getting really exciting, I'm finally starting to see where all the theory was leading!

### Day 15: 2018 February 7, Wednesday 

**Today's Progress**: After one short break, I resumed facing some JavaScript problem sets. In particular, I'm studying functions and regular expressions. My goal is to try to expand the given functions and make them more "user interactive". For example, I was given this function which returns "true" if a number is even, and "false" otherwise. Here it is: 

function isEven(num) {
	if (num % 2 === 0) {
		return true;
	} else {
		return false;
	}
}
isEven(4);

What I did was declaring a variable which stores the value input established by the user:

var check = prompt(Number.num);
function isEven(num) {
	if (num % 2 === 0) {
		return true;
	} else {
		return false;
	}
}
isEven(check);

**Thoughts:** I wanna practice more and more and go beyond the task expectations by making the functions user interactive/input sensitive. 

### Day 16: 2018 February 8, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I learnt about higher order functions and I started refreshing Arrays. I also connected my account to different platforms, incuding LinkedIn (where I also subscribed to several programming groups), Facebook, Google+, etc. I'm motivated and pretty focussed. Slowly but steady :)

**Thoughts:** I should study the code of more designs and templates and try to realize some decent mock-ups. I should also study CSS Grid and flex-box.

### Day 16: 2018 February 9, Friday

**Today's Progress**: So, back into JavaScript world. I've studied Arrays + built-in methods, practiced forEach quite a lot, solved a few problems, etc. Back-end has a grip on me, clearly.

**Thoughts:** I plan to go through all my old codes and try to refactor them in a way so as to include what I've been learning so far. I think it'd be a great practice.

### Day 17: 2018 February 10, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I practiced Arrays by try solving some problem sets, and I reviewed my old fuctions (I checked what I needed to implement/refactor them entirely). I also started Wes Bos "JavaScript 30" online course. More projects to come!

**Thoughts:** At the moment I have a few JS projects in mind: a Todo List app (nothing fancy, but I'd like to add some styling), a calculator app, a program which analyze an array and allow to manipulate its items (returning the data type, reversing the order, printing the item with the highest/lowest value, etc.).

### Day 18: 2018 February 11, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Back into Web Dev. I started two simple projects: a simple modal which shows a text-box when a button is clicked (no libraries, only Vanilla JS), and a full screen image slider (plain JS again and flexbox). 

**Thoughts:** Coding along with some amazing guys on Youtube really helps. However, in order to cement the knowledge, I'd better practice more and more every day. 

### Day 19: 2018 February 12, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I followed a video by Traversy Media (on Youtube), and I build a simple website with a parallax effect. I also added a JS function for playing a .wav file on window load. I also completed a mini course on Codeacademy about how to "animate your name". Pretty cool!

**Thoughts:** I wanna research and practice more with @media queries and animations in CSS3. Overall, I feel I'm on the right track.
