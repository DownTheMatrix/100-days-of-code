# #100DaysOfCode Log - [Bruno Mazza]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 4, Thursday, 2018].

### Day 0: 2018 January 4, Thursday

##### Premise: I started studying coding a few months ago, but I really never established a discipline. In November 2017 I passed the first selection for the Google/Udacity Scholarship for Front-End Development, and I'm currently busy trying to adding extra functionalities to my final project. I'm also studying Python (Udemy, Codeacademy, SoloLearn), and I will keep track of it as well. 

**Today's Progress**: I'm still working on my Pixel Art Maker project. In a brief, the user can select the grid size, pick a color and draw in the grid cells. 
I've created a button which toggle the music on/off. I styled the buttons and created a transition effect on button hover.

**Thoughts:** I'm pretty satisfied of the result so far, visually at least, considering the fact that I started this completely new journey only in October 2017. At the moment I'm struggling with the implementation of a JavaScript functionality which should allow the user to erase the color from the grid cells just by right-clicking on it. As I'm getting gradually more confident with jQuery, I will probably use it to add the function.

### Day 1: 2018 January 5, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've styled the Pixel Art Maker and I introduced some small features. In a brief: 
- I've changed the background-color of the canvas and I've used a lighter color for the cells, with the result of having a better contrast with the background image;
- I've added a loop attribute for my audio/music element: now the music will keep on playing until the user decides to stop it by pressing the toggle music on/off button.

**Thoughts**: I want to create a function which limits the grid size so as to avoid a browser crash. I think that a conditional might serve the purpose. i plan to dive deep into the documentation once again.

### Day 2: 2018 January 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've resumed the JavaScript course on FreeCodeCamp, and I've learnt quite a few things. Now I know the difference between global and local variables, and I practiced them both in different scenarios. 

**Thoughts:** I'm currently engaged on different e-learning platforms: Udacity, Udemy, FreeCodeCamp, SoloLearn and W3Schools. I plan to resume studying Python intensively as soon as I feel confident enough with JavaScript. My method is to create a small program or a document and put what I studied into practice as soon as possible. 

### Day 3: 2018 January 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: After a brief break, I resumed diving into JavaScript. I started the online course "Watch and Code", which was recommended to me by some fellow students. The course comes revolves about the building of a real application (an interactive "To Do List"), and it comes with many practical examples. 

**Thoughts:** In order to advance fast enough I'm gonna continue with the courses I'm currently following and implement what I learn asap. Next step will be the completion of a portfolio webpage, which could also prove useful in the future. 

### Day 4: 2018 January 11, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I went on with the "Watch and Code" course (I'm at a 15% completion now), and I've reviewed some basic JS concepts such as function, scope atc.

**Thoughts:** I will study how to make my portfolio page, using all the languages I've been studying so far.

### Day 5: 2018 January 12, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I took a detour from the Pixel Art Maker Project and I resumed some Front-End Development course. I created a content slider with a vertical menu and a few slides. I plan to play around with the code to add some extra functionalities.

**Thoughts:** I feel that refreshing HTML, CSS and JS is mandatory at this point.

### Day 6: 2018 January 13, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I started a course on Udemy about Web Development which covers basically everything. HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, MongoDB, YelpCamp, etc. 

**Thoughts:** It feels good to refresh some basic stuff at this point. For instance, I didn't remember how to write forms for visually impaired people (<label for><input id>). I will keep on going and start some cool projects asap.

### Day 7: 2018 January 14, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've deepened my knowledge about CSS selectors and pseudo-classes. I Found this [article](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize--net-16048) extremely useful. 

**Thoughts:** I plan to create a few websites using pure CSS AND with some JS for practicing as much as possible.

### Day 8: 2018 January 28, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: After a long break due to some personal issues, I've finally resumed my journey. 
Today I completed the last CSS3 course I signed up for, and I'm now moving to the Bootstrap section. 

**Thoughts:** I plan to build a blog (landing page, navbar and menus), an interactive dictionary using Python and a responsive video gallery. 

### Day 9: 2018 January 31, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I went through 3 courses on Codeacademy, and I completed them: 1. Learn Bootstrap, 2. Learn Command Line.

**Thoughts:** Learning Bootstrap surely speeds up everything when it comes to build a website. However, at this stage I still prefer to keep on building pages from a scratch. The more the practice, the better. I save the shortcuts for later.

### Day 10: 2018 February 1, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I finally startec working on my Portfolio Page, where I will make sure to use all the basic skills I've been studying so far (I will include some Bootstrap classes as well). Today I've wrote down the layout using pen&paper, and tomorrow I will start building the page section by section.

**Thoughts:** I'm currently studying how to divide a website just by looking at it. <Header>, <section> (<article> and <aside>) and <footer>. I plan to become effectively capable of assessing a website structure as fast as possible. 
  
### Day 11: 2018 February 2, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I studied the Bootstrap grid system, what it is, how it works, what are the 4 different sizes, how to nest rows.

**Thoughts:** I'm about to start an Image Gallery project using Boostrap. I'm also studying the code of different successfully websites to quickly assess their structure.  

### Day 12: 2018 February 3, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I kept on practicing with Bootstrap, and I created a couple of pages: an [Image Gallery](https://codepen.io/BrandNew_12/pen/xYZxdm) and a [Landing Page](https://codepen.io/BrandNew_12/pen/payzQy) for a fictitious company. In both projects I played around with icons and gliphycons. 

**Thoughts:** I'm starting to see how it works now, all I need is just... a lot of more practice!

### Day 13: 2018 February 4, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I spent the afternoon facing some coding challenges. I tried Codewars, Coderbyte and Hackerrank, just to get some ideas of what to expect. I must admit I found even the most basic ones kinda hard, which means that I'd better practice more and more.

**Thoughts:** I'm gonna continue with the courses and, at the same time, I'm gonna build some easy applications to test my knowledge step by step. Stay tuned!

### Day 14: 2018 February 5, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Continuining with the JS course on Udemy, now currently busy with the control flow. I solved more than 10 problem sets about while and for loops.

**Thoughts:** This is getting really exciting, I'm finally starting to see where all the theory was leading!

### Day 15: 2018 February 7, Wednesday 

**Today's Progress**: After one short break, I resumed facing some JavaScript problem sets. In particular, I'm studying functions and regular expressions. My goal is to try to expand the given functions and make them more "user interactive". For example, I was given this function which returns "true" if a number is even, and "false" otherwise. Here it is: 

function isEven(num) {
	if (num % 2 === 0) {
		return true;
	} else {
		return false;
	}
}
isEven(4);

What I did was declaring a variable which stores the value input established by the user:

var check = prompt(Number.num);
function isEven(num) {
	if (num % 2 === 0) {
		return true;
	} else {
		return false;
	}
}
isEven(check);

**Thoughts:** I wanna practice more and more and go beyond the task expectations by making the functions user interactive/input sensitive. 

### Day 16: 2018 February 8, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I learnt about higher order functions and I started refreshing Arrays. I also connected my account to different platforms, incuding LinkedIn (where I also subscribed to several programming groups), Facebook, Google+, etc. I'm motivated and pretty focussed. Slowly but steady :)

**Thoughts:** I should study the code of more designs and templates and try to realize some decent mock-ups. I should also study CSS Grid and flex-box.

### Day 16: 2018 February 9, Friday

**Today's Progress**: So, back into JavaScript world. I've studied Arrays + built-in methods, practiced forEach quite a lot, solved a few problems, etc. Back-end has a grip on me, clearly.

**Thoughts:** I plan to go through all my old codes and try to refactor them in a way so as to include what I've been learning so far. I think it'd be a great practice.

### Day 17: 2018 February 10, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I practiced Arrays by try solving some problem sets, and I reviewed my old fuctions (I checked what I needed to implement/refactor them entirely). I also started Wes Bos "JavaScript 30" online course. More projects to come!

**Thoughts:** At the moment I have a few JS projects in mind: a Todo List app (nothing fancy, but I'd like to add some styling), a calculator app, a program which analyze an array and allow to manipulate its items (returning the data type, reversing the order, printing the item with the highest/lowest value, etc.).

### Day 18: 2018 February 11, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Back into Web Dev. I started two simple projects: a simple modal which shows a text-box when a button is clicked (no libraries, only Vanilla JS), and a full screen image slider (plain JS again and flexbox). 

**Thoughts:** Coding along with some amazing guys on Youtube really helps. However, in order to cement the knowledge, I'd better practice more and more every day. 

### Day 19: 2018 February 12, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I followed a video by Traversy Media (on Youtube), and I build a simple website with a parallax effect. I also added a JS function for playing a .wav file on window load. I also completed a mini course on Codeacademy about how to "animate your name". Pretty cool!

**Thoughts:** I wanna research and practice more with @media queries and animations in CSS3. Overall, I feel I'm on the right track.

### Day 20: 2018 February 14, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I started a Movie DB app which uses different functions for allowing the user to input the title, rating, duration and more of his/her favorite movies. It's a Todo list really, but it uses forEach loops (good practice for my still unrefined skills). I'm also growing the habit to refactor what I've just wrote in different ways to see if it still works. Finally, last but certainly not least, I received the notification from the Udacity team that I've been admitted to the last phase of Google Front End Development scholarship! I'm so excited about it, now it's time to get things done ;)

**Thoughts:** I want to commit fully to the scholarship program, and I also want to use all my spare time to practice and keep on going with the other courses on Udemy. I'd better establish a schedule which includes other things such as sport though: my mental health first!

### Day 21: 2018 February 15, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Yes! I've started the phase 2 of the Udacity Front End Scholarship, and I submitted my first task (an "Animal Trading Card" project). Then, I used my spare time to continue with the Colt's course. Today's topic: DOM manipulation. Finally, I threw some ideas for the Movie Database Project. 

**Thoughts:** The phase 2 is a great opportunity for reviewing my CSS knowledge and learn new tricks about how to interact with the page elements. It started today and will last until the 15th of August. No excuses!

### Day 22: 2018 February 16, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I went on with the course and learned about many functionalities of Chrome Dev Tools for emulating and testing a webpage on different devices. Then I worked on my Movie Database app and finally I looked at some new CSS3 properties.

**Thoughts:** In order to avoid the mental institution, I'd better alternate between back-end and front-end, with the latter adding, literally, some color to my mood.

### Day 23: 2018 February 17, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I watched a couple of videos and read a few articles about media queries and how to make a webpage responsive. I heard the concept "mobile first, start small" many times already, and I plan to deepen the topic. I'm also refactoring some old codes and, finally, I started a webpage where it's possible to interact with different elements and run, via JS, a few CSS tricks (such as transformations etc.). I'ts pretty funny, and I think it's a good practice playground. 

**Thoughts:** I'm gathering as much info as possible, reading as much articles as possible, and the same goes for the videos. I also bought my first e-reader ever just for the sake of studying/reading a few programming e-books I had in my laptop ("Learn python the hard way" and "JavaScript Notes for Professionals" included). 

### Day 24: 2018 February 18, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I watched a tutorial about Animate.js, and I got super interested in what I could achieve with that library. I can't wait to start messing around with it! I also studied flexbox and practiced more @media queries. Finally, I took a good look at several portfolio websites of other web devs to draw some ideas for mine. Some of them look amazing, so... it's gonna be tough!

**Thoughts:** I wanna practice my JS skills as much as possible, and the same goes for DOM manipulation and CSS grid system.

### Day 25: 2018 February 20, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Ok, so: I have to do the mock-up of a portfolio page and I don't want to use any framework like Bootstrap. It's hard, harder than I thought. Today I've watched two more tutorials about CSS Grid and its logic. I love it, I thought I could use it right after but I was wrong. I understand how it works, but things get messed up in my mind as soon as I start adding more elements (the grid-area property, in particular, gave me a nice headache). It's a long and winding road, indeed. 

**Thoughts:** Drawing sketches before even starting to code might be a good habit and I want to develop it. I must find a way to keep frustration at bay.

### Day 26: 2018 February 21, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: So, I kept on going with the scholarship and completed the section about responsiveness. Then i felt like taking a break from web dev and going back to my first passion: Python. I wrote a quick and simple program which reminds me to take a nice break every 60 minutes and which also opens a url (I used the webbrowser module) after displaying an alert box (tkinter, messagebox). I will refine the UI and explore tkinter asap.

**Thoughts:** Python is really enjoyable, and I can't wait to spend more time on it. About the portfolio page, tomorrow I will test a few solutions I planned. Fingers crossed!

### Day 27: 2018 February 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: So, I decided to build the skeleton of my portfolio page using Bootstrap for now. Later I refactor it using CSS Grid. It has a clean layout, but I plan to add modals and, possibly, a vertical sidebar with dropdowns submenus. 
I also wrote a simple program in Python which iterates through the files in a directory and modify the file name. In order to do that, I had to dive into the documentation and study a few modules. Pretty nice stuff!

**Thoughts:** I use Python 3x, and I had some errors when I tried to run my program today. After scratching my head for a while, I discovered that string translation changed from version 2, and it's now syntactically different. Python os library is pretty broad, so I'm gonna focus on the most important and useful methods. 

### Day 28: 2018 February 23, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I researched about "how to practice effetively my CSS", and I came across the post of one guy who suggested doing some mock-ups of the website wireframes posted on sites like Dribble. I never thought about that, and I think it'd be helpful in the long run. I also went on with the JS course on Udemy, and I tried to add a few effects to my portfolio page (image overlay, fade, shine, etc.). In the end I discarded them all, as I wasn't fully satisfied. 

**Thoughts:** Messing with the animations is super cool, but not useful at this stage. I'd better focus on the backbone of my webpage.

### Day 29: 2018 February 25, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I started a "Color Guessing Game" which allows me to put into practice all the stuff that I've been studying so far, from DOM manipulation, to events handling, to layout structuring, to basic JS logic. I plan to complete it within a couple of days.

**Thoughts:** I started to make good use of the simple "alarm clock" program I wrote in Python: now, every hour, the program notifies me that it's time for a breif break (up to 5 minutes). I also want to insert a logic that, after a certain amount of time (say, 4 hours), the program alerts me that I should stop for at least 15 minutes. It would be cool if it could open a video about stretching muscles after long sessions behind the computer, or some meditation/ambient music, etc.

### Day 30: 2018 February 26, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I enrolled in the Wes Bos "CSS Grid" course as I decided it just makes too much sense to favor other frameworks. I will refactor the portfolio page using it, no shortcuts, no regrets. Amen. I also resumed the course on DataQuest, and I confirmed my interest for data structures and lists manipulation. 

**Thoughts:** Ok, the new schedule is as follows: 3 hours in the morning for the Front-End, 2 hours in the afternoon for the Back-End (databases, Python, etc.). In the spare time, some related book I downloaded in my e-reader. I'm curious to see if this new strategy works better.

### Day 31: 2018 February 27, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I kept on going with Grid and watched 3 tutorials. Then I discovered Rachel Andrew's "Grid By Example" and I played around with the layouts. It's still rusty, but it's sinking in. Slowly but steady.

**Thoughts:** grid-template-areas is the key for quick designs, but it's gonna take a while to sink in. I hope I can find more online playgrounds to practice it!

### Day 32: 2018 February 28, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: More tuts about Grid, one simple "RGB Color Game" completed and several headaches. 

**Thoughts:** I read an article about JS design patterns, i.e.: the way to write JS code more efficiently. It's a brand new world really, I will keep it in mind but I'd better move on for now. 

### Day 33: 2018 March 1, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I started a course on Udacity about how to make the images responsive on any kind of device. After each lesson I practiced the new properties I came across with (i.e.: 'srcset', 'sizes', relative measuring units like vw, etc.). In the afternoon I resumed a course on Dataquest about Python and I practiced a lot. In particular, I learned how to iterate through the elements inside nested lists and how to manipulate them using the 'split()' method. Cool!

**Thoughts:** I like this new habit of splitting the day in two halves: morning dedicated to Front-End, and afternoon/late evening to Python and Back-End stuff. Side note: I plan to start learning mySQL asap!

### Day 34: 2018 March 4, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed the mock up of two templates (Themeforest). I used a framework for the first one and GRID for the second. Then I started to write a Python app which redirects the user to specified websites. Finally, I completed two challenges on DataQuest.

**Thoughts:** My laptop had some issues and I needed to transfer the data to another one. I carried on despite the hassle, and that's nice.

### Day 35: 2018 March 5, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I started studying, practicing (and appreciating) the new featured brought into JavaScript by ES6. I wrote several functions using pre and post-ES6 methods. For instance, if I had to calculate the average (mean) of the numbers in an array, I wrote a function which used a standard for loop first, and then the same one using a for...of loop and a rest parameter.

**Thoughts:** I scratched my head as my function kept on returning NaN when no parameter was passed into it (i.e.: `average()`). I solved the puzzle after researching for a while. In the end I used the `parseFloat()` function and `toFixed()`, and it worked!

### Day 36: 2018 March 6, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I built the structure for a Memory Game ("Concentration") using CSS Grid. I will start adding the logic after planning all the necessary steps. 

**Thoughts:** Grid is really nice. I need way more practice when it comes to align the content inside of the containers though. 

### Day 37-38: 2018 March 7-8, Wednesday-Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I'm updating my log for two days as I had some connection issues yesterday. That didn't stop me from practicing though! So, I added the logic for my Memory Game project, and I implemented a few features, like a modal that is displayed upon the game completion, a restart command for refreshing the game (and shuffling the cards again), a background music on window load, etc. What I'm trying to achieve now is to keep track of the number of moves according to the number of clicks. Then I need to make sure that this is stored somewhere as it should affect the final score. Not as easy as it sounds!

**Thoughts:** This project is really cool and I'm enjoying squeezing my brain over it. Once completed I will definitely write more simple games like that. 

### Day 39: 2018 March 9, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I installed Git Bash and I practiced the basics of Version Control. I also learned the basic, most used Shell commands. Finally, I watched a tut of TraversyMedia about how to create a Bookmarker app with JS. Cool!

**Thoughts:** Things are getting exciting. The puzzle is taking shape, gradually, everyday. My mind is becoming more and more flexible when it comes to understand new concepts. Time to get things done!

### Day 40: 2018 March 11, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I kept studying and researching about the DOM. I learned about new event handlers, the phases of the events and about the difference between the different methods applicable. I finally feel like I'm getting a grasp on this stuff!

**Thoughts:** I decided to refactor the code for the Memory Game app in order to put into practice the new knowledges. In particular, I want to build the HTML necessary using Vanilla JS. I'm not in a rush, but I wanna deliver a fine project this time.

### Day 41: 2018 March 12, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I went on with the Memory Game project and planned a couple of alternatives to the my old code. I also practiced some new methods for the DOM interaction. Finally, I started refactoring (for real) my portfolio page.

**Thoughts:** I should take a break from the courses and dedicate a few hours to practice only. So much info, so much theory. It's due, but clearly not enough. 

### Day 42: 2018 March 14, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed a To-Do list project (I know, I know) and I learned a lot of stuff about new  ECMAscript Edition 6 features, such as Arrow Functions, etc. I also resumed the Wes Bos JavaScript30 course and I customized his DrumKit project by using CSS Grid and adding a few animations.

**Thoughts:** I plan to expand current projects and to practice Grid more and more. Switching from jQuery to plain JS and back is painful, but it's getting more and more tolerable every day.

### Day 43: 2018 March 19, Monday

**Today's Progress**: After 3 days of stop I resumed the journey where I left it: the Memory Game to deliver within next week. I modified a few things and discarded the rest. I added some styling and effects. Then, I studied the documentation of NumPy and practiced for one hour.

**Thoughts:** I plan to complete the project in the next days and then continuing with the lessons. I also intend to dedicate at least a couple of hours per day to Python libraries for Data Science.

### Day 44: 2018 March 20, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I started a great tutorial on how to properly use GitHub, and I realized how wrong I've been doing it for all this time. Time to amend then. I completed a PataTaP Clone project (with paper.js and howler.js) and I learned how to test a website locally so as to avoid CORS issues. In order to achieve this, I researched a lot and I finally managed to configure the IIS on my computer and add/bind the site correctly. It took me a while but I'm happy with the results.

**Thoughts:** I plan to modify the PataTap Clone project in order to make the code more efficient, and I also want to add different animations and shapes. The main focus shall be on the Memory Game project though. 

### Day 45: 2018 March 21, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I implemented a modal for my PataTap Clone project, as well as an animation. Then, I rewrote the code for the Memory Game project using jQuery.

**Thoughts:** I realized, thanks to a fellow student feedback, that in my code there were parts of code written with both Vanilla JS and jQuery. This resulted in a confusing and not acceptably readable code. From now on I'd better to stick to one style instead of mixing both native and frameworks.

### Day 46: 2018 March 22, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I learned about how to undo changes and merge confilcts with Git. Then I implemented a count-up timer on document ready for my Memory Game project, using the following syntax: `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {startTimer()};` and I finally solved my first two challenges on HackerRank.

**Thoughts:** If I want to deliver the project within the next few days, I should speed everything up. In particular, I should test the app on different devices and add media queries where needed.

### Day 47: 2018 March 23, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I practiced JS arrow functions and other ES6 new features. Then I started a course about SQL and Databases. I've been wanting to do that for a while, and I'm happy I've finally did.

**Thoughts:** I plan to resume working on the Memory Game app, and keep on going with courses I've been following.

### Day 48: 2018 March 24, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I added two main functionality to the Memory Game: the count-up timer now counts seconds and minutes, and it's reset when the game is won. Furthermore, all the game stats (time and number of moves) are summed up in the modal which pops up upon game completion. Finally, I kept on going with the SQL course on Codecademy. 

**Thoughts:** This project is giving me a hard time, sign that my JS skills are still far from being good. I'm going to practice them and solve more challenges on the web. 

### Day 49: 2018 March 25, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I fixed an issue with the Memory Game project and added the correct animation when two cards match together. I also rewrote a function and got rid of the deprecated inline `onclick=function()`. Then I went on with my Python course on DataCamp, and I completed the first track (lists, numPy, built-in methods). Finally, I completed the SQL course on Codeacademy.

**Thoughts:** Working with different type of data is getting more and more clear everyday. I'm also faster than I was when it comes to detect an issue and, possibly, fix it in JS. Time for more challenges!

### Day 50: 2018 March 27, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I started the course "SQL for Data Science" on DataCamp. I like it, it's so intuitive compared to the languages I've been studying so far. I also went on with the "Descriptive Statistics" course on Udacity, and I practiced my first dataset ever using matplotlib and numpy. Really interesting stuff.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I'm going to complete the Memory Game project and deliver it. Then I will proceed with the next section in the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree, which is about code optimization.

### Day 51: 2018 March 28, Wedsnesday

**Today's Progress**: I refactored the Memory Game a little bit, and I watched a tutorial about HTML5 Canvas (it's gonna be useful for the next FEND project). Then, I went on with the SQL course.

**Thoughts:** I delivered the Memory Game app but it didn't pass. I felt frustrated, but it didn't last. After a while I went through the review and I discovered how true and agreeable the reasons were. To put it simply: my code is not readable and consistent enough. In theory I know how to use objects and ECMA6 practices, but I seldom use them. The same goes for many other good shortcuts I could take and that I don't for lack of self-confidence, or laziness, or both. That being said, I'm gonna work harder and I'm gonna check, this time thoroughly, what I write. Taking into accounts everything (a11y issues, responsiveness, etc.) is probably a lot for me at this early stage, but I'm gonna do my best. Finally, I want to start a blog and share the hurdles and the satisfactions of this incredible journey. 

### Day 52: 2018 March 29, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I rewrote parts of the code (created objets and optimized the readability) and delivered the Memory Game app. Then I went on with the SQL course. Finally, I watched a tutorial about OOP.

**Thoughts:** More and more practice, there's no other way. May the Force be with me. 

### Day 53: 2018 March 30, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I refactored the Memory Game app code (still one bug with the clicking function to fix, but I'm on it). Then I practiced JS and finally I completed the SQL course on DataCamp.

**Thoughts:** My mind is starting to process all the new information in a quick and less painful fashion. I'm ready to take it to the next level by dive into ES6, SQL intermediate and backend best practices. Anyway, I plan to refresh the new concepts often and to practice a lot.		

### Day 54: 2018 March 31, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I studied the "array iterator methods" in JS. I went through the most common methods, specifically: 
+ .forEach()
+ .map()
+ .filter()
+ .reduce()
+ .some()
+ .every()
+ .find()
+ .findIndex()
Then I practiced them and wrote down a few examples for each of them. 

**Thoughts:** I would need to write an app which makes use of those methods, in order to see them playing an active role in a real world application. 

### Day 55: 2018 April 04, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I spent the last 3 days studying the best accessibility practices, from better contrast ratios, to use Wai-Arias to make custom elements accessible to different kind of users, to finally take advantage of the Audit mode in the Dev Tools to run accessibility tests on my webpages.

**Thoughts:** Making a website is complex enough, and now that I looked at how to make a webpage fully accessible, it's even worse! I really need a lot of experience to digest these new possibilities. That being said, I completely agree with the philosophy behind the need for responsive, accessible web apps. 

### Day 56: 2018 April 05, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I almost completed the Udacity course section about OOP with JavaScript, pretty interesting. Then I build a simple template using CSS Grid and Flexbox.

**Thoughts:** The next project is approaching, I need to finish the section real quick!

### Day 57: 2018 April 07, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: So, I spent the whole morning learning about how to create Lambda Functions for Amazon Alexa, and I managed to build a model with an intent and a slot. I loved that, that's really interesting and I will defintelly deepen it. Then, I studied Closures in JS.

**Thoughts:** Today I needed a break from my usual studying routine, and I decided to try out Alexa's skills. That was my first attempt, but I have to say that it was pretty intuitive. I should probably refresh my JSON though.


### Day 58: 2018 April 08, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I studied closures and IIFE in JavaScript, and I actually understood what they do and when it's better to use them, many thanks to the Udacity course and Douglas Crockford's lecture! Then I resumed my journey through FreeCodeCamp challenges.

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling more confident when it comes too understand things at a conceptual level. More practice is due though.

### Day 59, 60: 2018 April 09, April 10 Monday, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: In the past two days I studied new JS methods: `.call()`, `.apply()`, `.bind()`. I worked my way to comprehension through some practical examples and exercises. Then I build the layout of two different websites using CSS Grid and Flexbox only (no frameworks).

**Thoughts:** I'm curious and excited about how to implement these new concepts into real apps!

### Day 61: 2018 April 12 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Arrow functions, default parameters, destructuring, and other ES6 newly-introduced features. 

**Thoughts:** I resumed the track on FreeCodeCamp, almost done with the JS section. Next one: algorithms! 

### Day 62: 2018 April 13 Friday

**Today's Progress**: More about classes and sub-classes in JS (ES6). Then I completed all the basic SQL challenges on Hackerrank.

**Thoughts:** Classes in JS require more practice as they're not immediately intuitive. I'm on it though, so no worries.

### Day 63: 2018 April 14 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Again on classes, constructors, getters, setters and static methods. I'm learning a ton about this important part of the JavaScript language. Next stop: symbols. Oh, and I installed Babel and run my very first transpilation ever, "translating" a js from ES6 to ES5 syntax.

**Thoughts:** I can't wait to put all of this into a full-fledged application!

### Day 64: 2018 April 15 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Symbols, Sets, WeakSets, Maps, WeakMaps. It's gonna take some time to let these new concepts to sink in.

**Thoughts:** The next project for the Udacity Nanodegree is approaching: a Classic Arcade Game ("Frog") Clone. Skills to possess: HTML5 Canvas, JS OOP knowledge, and more.

### Day 65: 2018 April 7 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: ES6 again. Today I've met Promises, Generators and Polyfills. I find Generators slightly more understandable compared to the other concepts, but it will take some time to let everything sink in.

**Thoughts:** I'm one lesson before the next scholarship project. I'm very curious about how to implement all the things I've been learning.

### Day 66: 2018 April 30 Monday

**Today's Progress**: I started working on my next project for the FEND scholarship program. I'm supposed to rely on OOP features to build the core game functionalities.

**Thoughts:** First of all, I'm going to write down a list of classes and objects I need for the game. The most intuitive ones are the player and the enemies classes. Then, I will instantiate them and use inheritance to pass the properties to similar classes.

### Day 67: 2018 May 1st Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I implemented the basic functionalities for the game (such as player movements), and I studied a few concepts that might be useful later. In particular, I followed a tutorial about how to use spatial partitioning to improve collision detection performance for 2D games.

**Thoughts:** It's a brand new world. Tough, but I'm enjoying learning about it!

### Day 68-69: 2018 May 3rd, 4th

**Today's Progress**: I finally delivered my Frogger-style game for the FEND program! I plan to refactor the code and amply its possibilities and functionalities as soon as I learn new things. I'm very happy with how it's going!

**Thoughts:** OOP is great, but I think that functional programming works better in the long run. At least, that's what I got after watching a few videos. 

### Day 70-71: 2018 May 5th, 6th

**Today's Progress**: I met Gulp and started diving into best practices and tasks automation. It's a really interesting addition.

**Thoughts:** I plan to reorganize my old projects bringing onto the table the new concepts I've learned so far.

### Day 72: 2018 May 7th

**Today's Progress**: New project, new challenge. I must compile a feed reader testing app. To do that, I must get familiar with the Jasmine framework for live testing, and create a few test expectations. In order for the project to succeed, all the tests must pass.

**Thoughts:** Differently from the previous projects, this is completely new to me. I guess i'd need some time to let it sink in.

### Day 73: 2018 May 8th

**Today's Progress**: I experimented with Jasmine live-testing and I wrote my first specs.

**Thoughts:** In order to deliver the project successfully, I must spend more time on practicing.

### Day 74: 2018 May 9th

**Today's Progress**: I completed the first test of my Feed Reader Testing application.

**Thoughts:** It's kinda tough as I'm not familiar with the syntax (yet). However, I plan to follow multiple tutorials to help me with that.

### Day 75: 2018 May 15th

**Today's Progress**: I wrote the first 3 suites with Jasmine for my app. Then I deepened a little bit my understanding of closures in JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** Testing is clearly an interesting skill to have in one's toolset. I will spend more time on this.

### Day 76: 2018 May 16th

**Today's Progress**: I completed a course about how to program a simple tennis game, and I made some modifications to it, adding more functionalities. Then I solved 2 algorithms on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** The algorithms are quite challenging, but I enjoy the process as they force me to dive deep into the relevant documentation(s) in order to solve them.

### Day 77: 2018 May 17th

**Today's Progress**: I submitted the Feed Reader App and I learned how to dynamically create DOM elements using JavaScript and CSS Grid. Then I solved one algorithm challenge on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I plan to create my own Bookmarking app using the techniques I've learned so far.

### Day 78: 2018 May 18th

**Today's Progress**: I refactored the code for the Testing App, and I started diving into the back-end world. I'm gonna use Cloud9 as an IDE for developing my first Express App. I'm very excited about it!

**Thoughts:** I plan to study new topics while I keep on going with the course, and I want to commit to solving at leat one algorithm challenge per day from now on.

### Day 79: 2018 May 20th

**Today's Progress**: I went on with the Udacity course and I'm now tackling best practices on how to organize the code. I came across for the 1st time with the distinction between View and Model, and how to separate them. Then I started a website bookmarker app using Vanilla JS.

**Thoughts:** It's interesting how planning the code ahead makes things faster and easier at a later stage. I should go through my old repos and reorganize them.

### Day 80: 2018 May 21st

**Today's Progress**: I completed the initial stage of my Bookmarker App, which I plan to expand so as to include several new features. I also want to change the style and test different solutions.

**Thoughts:** Thanks to the tutorial I followed on Youtube, I got to know localStorage (and JSON), and how to use it properly to build a simple app. It's an interesting topic. 

### Day 81: 2018 May 31st

**Today's Progress**: I've started reading "Eloquent JavaScript", and I intend to complete all the exercises present in the book. I also kept on going with Promises in JS, and I learned how to chain them.

**Thoughts:** I plan to resume studying intensively, committing every day for at least 6 hours per day.

### Day 82-83: 2018 June 1st, 2nd

**Today's Progress**: The last two days were dedicated to study "Eloquent JavaScript" in depth while solving the exercises. I also started working on an app which retrieves information from different sources using APIs, and returns them to the user through a GUI.

**Thoughts:** From now on asynch requests, JSON methods and certificates shall become my bread and butter.

### Day 84-85: 2018 June 5th, 6th

**Today's Progress**: Fetch API as an alternative to XHR requests, some server side study cases, a few algorithm challenges on Codefights and FreeCodeCamp, and a lot of headaches.

**Thoughts:** What I'm studying now is, possible, the toughest challenge since I embarked on this journey. Async requests, Promises and other related concepts are fundamental though, so I'd better practice relentlessly. 

### Day 86-87: 2018 June 7th, 8th

**Today's Progress**: Started to tackle Backbone.js. It's weird, but from I've got so far, it'd be very interesting to learn.

**Thoughts:** So far I've been mixing 	quite a few concepts and languages, but I feel like I'm becoming able to sustain the mental effort. I plan to focus on a few areas very soon though. 

### Day 88-89-90: 2018 June 11th, 12th, 13th

**Today's Progress**: Recently I've been testing and implementing the new Fetch API, Service Workers and Promises intensively. Things are far from being sky-clear, but they're starting to make sense!

**Thoughts:** I'm happy about my learning pace. It's probably slower than before, but I feel it's more solid.

### Day 91: 2018 June 28th

**Today's Progress**: I resumed tackling the Restaurant Reviews App, and in order to do that, I felt I needed to review some related topics, such as: AJAX, Http Request, Fetch API, XHR, etc. Then I solved a couple of coding challenges and implemented what I re-learnt.

**Thoughts:** I must make sure to start a small project everytime I come across some new concepts, so as to cement what I learn.

### Day 92: 2018 July 1st 

**Today's Progress**: I made the restaurant app responsive (50%) for smaller devices, and I started coding the service worker for caching the files and make the app usable offline. Then I practiced with mySQL.

**Thoughts:** I'm switching from XHR to Fetch API entirely, and I plan to refactor the code in my other apps as well accordingly. 

### Day 93: 2018 July 4th

**Today's Progress**: Again on the app, this time registering my service worker after checking that the browser supports it. Then I kept on going with the mySQL course.

**Thoughts:** Making a progressive web app is tough, but it's clearly a must-have skill. I'm gonna practice harder.

### Day 94: 2018 September 24th

**Today's Progress**: Can't believe how much time passed since my last update of the log. During this "gap" I learnt a ton of new things: I learnt the foundations of React.js, I completed my Udacity Nanodegree program, and I'm now continuing building up my skills and practicing like crazy.  

**Thoughts:** I've almost completed my portfolio website, which I plan to deploy asap. I'm also following a couple of tutorials at the same time: one about how to make an app with Express, and another about advanced SASS and CSS.

### Day 95: 2018 October 22th

**Today's Progress**: I've completed the portfolio website, and I'm now testing it in order to improve the performance metrics. I'm also wondering if I should keep a multi-pages architecture, or switch to a seemingly more contemporary one-page layout. Furthermore, I'm commiting daily to the FreeCodeCamp challenges, and I plan to get all the Front End certificates by the end of this year. Finally, I'm experimenting with SASS. 

**Thoughts:** I'm proud of my progresses: I'm now able to tackle basic to intermediate algorithm challenges in JavaScript and Python, something that wasn't even thinkable only a few months ago. I plan to train everyday so as to be ready when a job interview occurs.
