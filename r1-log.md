# #100DaysOfCode Log - [Bruno Mazza]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 4, Thursday, 2018].

### Day 0: 2018 January 4, Thursday

##### Premise: I started studying coding a few months ago, but I really never established a discipline. In November 2017 I passed the first selection for the Google/Udacity Scholarship for Front-End Development, and I'm currently busy trying to adding extra functionalities to my final project. I'm also studying Python (Udemy, Codeacademy, SoloLearn), and I will keep track of it as well. 

**Today's Progress**: I'm still working on my Pixel Art Maker project. In a brief, the user can select the grid size, pick a color and draw in the grid cells. 
I've created a button which toggle the music on/off. I styled the buttons and created a transition effect on button hover.

**Thoughts:** I'm pretty satisfied of the result so far, visually at least, considering the fact that I started this completely new journey only in October 2017. At the moment I'm struggling with the implementation of a JavaScript functionality which should allow the user to erase the color from the grid cells just by right-clicking on it. As I'm getting gradually more confident with jQuery, I will probably use it to add the function.

### Day 1: 2018 January 5, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've styled the Pixel Art Maker and I introduced some small features. In a brief: 
- I've changed the background-color of the canvas and I've used a lighter color for the cells, with the result of having a better contrast with the background image;
- I've added a loop attribute for my audio/music element: now the music will keep on playing until the user decides to stop it by pressing the toggle music on/off button.

**Thoughts**: I want to create a function which limits the grid size so as to avoid a browser crash. I think that a conditional might serve the purpose. i plan to dive deep into the documentation once again.

### Day 2: 2018 January 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've resumed the JavaScript course on FreeCodeCamp, and I've learnt quite a few things. Now I know the difference between global and local variables, and I practiced them both in different scenarios. 

**Thoughts:** I'm currently engaged on different e-learning platforms: Udacity, Udemy, FreeCodeCamp, SoloLearn and W3Schools. I plan to resume studying Python intensively as soon as I feel confident enough with JavaScript. My method is to create a small program or a document and put what I studied into practice as soon as possible. 

### Day 3: 2018 January 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: After a brief break, I resumed diving into JavaScript. I started the online course "Watch and Code", which was recommended to me by some fellow students. The course comes revolves about the building of a real application (an interactive "To Do List"), and it comes with many practical examples. 

**Thoughts:** In order to advance fast enough I'm gonna continue with the courses I'm currently following and implement what I learn asap. Next step will be the completion of a portfolio webpage, which could also prove useful in the future. 

### Day 4: 2018 January 11, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I went on with the "Watch and Code" course (I'm at a 15% completion now), and I've reviewed some basic JS concepts such as function, scope atc.

**Thoughts:** I will study how to make my portfolio page, using all the languages I've been studying so far.

### Day 5: 2018 January 12, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I took a detour from the Pixel Art Maker Project and I resumed some Front-End Development course. I created a content slider with a vertical menu and a few slides. I plan to play around with the code to add some extra functionalities.

**Thoughts:** I feel that refreshing HTML, CSS and JS is mandatory at this point.

### Day 6: 2018 January 13, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I started a course on Udemy about Web Development which covers basically everything. HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, MongoDB, YelpCamp, etc. 

**Thoughts:** It feels good to refresh some basic stuff at this point. For instance, I didn't remember how to write forms for visually impaired people (<label for><input id>). I will keep on going and start some cool projects asap.

### Day 7: 2018 January 14, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've deepened my knowledge about CSS selectors and pseudo-classes. I Found this [article](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize--net-16048) extremely useful. 

**Thoughts:** I plan to create a few websites using pure CSS AND with some JS for practicing as much as possible.

### Day 8: 2018 January 28, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: After a long break due to some personal issues, I've finally resumed my journey. 
Today I completed the last CSS3 course I signed up for, and I'm now moving to the Bootstrap section. 

**Thoughts:** I plan to build a blog (landing page, navbar and menus), an interactive dictionary using Python and a responsive video gallery. 

### Day 9: 2018 January 31, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I went through 3 courses on Codeacademy, and I completed them: 1. Learn Bootstrap, 2. Learn Command Line.

**Thoughts:** Learning Bootstrap surely speeds up everything when it comes to build a website. However, at this stage I still prefer to keep on building pages from a scratch. The more the practice, the better. I save the shortcuts for later.

### Day 10: 2018 February 1, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I finally startec working on my Portfolio Page, where I will make sure to use all the basic skills I've been studying so far (I will include some Bootstrap classes as well). Today I've wrote down the layout using pen&paper, and tomorrow I will start building the page section by section.

**Thoughts:** I'm currently studying how to divide a website just by looking at it. <Header>, <section> (<article> and <aside>) and <footer>. I plan to become effectively capable of assessing a website structure as fast as possible. 
  
### Day 11: 2018 February 2, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I studied the Bootstrap grid system, what it is, how it works, what are the 4 different sizes, how to nest rows.

**Thoughts:** I'm about to start an Image Gallery project using Boostrap. I'm also studying the code of different successfully websites to quickly assess their structure.  

### Day 12: 2018 February 3, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I kept on practicing with Bootstrap, and I created a couple of pages: an [Image Gallery](https://codepen.io/BrandNew_12/pen/xYZxdm) and a [Landing Page](https://codepen.io/BrandNew_12/pen/payzQy) for a fictitious company. In both projects I played around with icons and gliphycons. 

**Thoughts:** I'm starting to see how it works now, all I need is just... a lot of more practice!

### Day 13: 2018 February 4, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I spent the afternoon facing some coding challenges. I tried Codewars, Coderbyte and Hackerrank, just to get some ideas of what to expect. I must admit I found even the most basic ones kinda hard, which means that I'd better practice more and more.

**Thoughts:** I'm gonna continue with the courses and, at the same time, I'm gonna build some easy applications to test my knowledge step by step. Stay tuned!

### Day 14: 2018 February 5, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Continuining with the JS course on Udemy, now currently busy with the control flow. I solved more than 10 problem sets about while and for loops.

**Thoughts:** This is getting really exciting, I'm finally starting to see where all the theory was leading!

### Day 15: 2018 February 7, Wednesday 

**Today's Progress**: After one short break, I resumed facing some JavaScript problem sets. In particular, I'm studying functions and regular expressions. My goal is to try to expand the given functions and make them more "user interactive". For example, I was given this function which returns "true" if a number is even, and "false" otherwise. Here it is: 

function isEven(num) {
	if (num % 2 === 0) {
		return true;
	} else {
		return false;
	}
}
isEven(4);

What I did was declaring a variable which stores the value input established by the user:

var check = prompt(Number.num);
function isEven(num) {
	if (num % 2 === 0) {
		return true;
	} else {
		return false;
	}
}
isEven(check);

**Thoughts:** I wanna practice more and more and go beyond the task expectations by making the functions user interactive/input sensitive. 

### Day 16: 2018 February 8, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I learnt about higher order functions and I started refreshing Arrays. I also connected my account to different platforms, incuding LinkedIn (where I also subscribed to several programming groups), Facebook, Google+, etc. I'm motivated and pretty focussed. Slowly but steady :)

**Thoughts:** I should study the code of more designs and templates and try to realize some decent mock-ups. I should also study CSS Grid and flex-box.

### Day 16: 2018 February 9, Friday

**Today's Progress**: So, back into JavaScript world. I've studied Arrays + built-in methods, practiced forEach quite a lot, solved a few problems, etc. Back-end has a grip on me, clearly.

**Thoughts:** I plan to go through all my old codes and try to refactor them in a way so as to include what I've been learning so far. I think it'd be a great practice.

### Day 17: 2018 February 10, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I practiced Arrays by try solving some problem sets, and I reviewed my old fuctions (I checked what I needed to implement/refactor them entirely). I also started Wes Bos "JavaScript 30" online course. More projects to come!

**Thoughts:** At the moment I have a few JS projects in mind: a Todo List app (nothing fancy, but I'd like to add some styling), a calculator app, a program which analyze an array and allow to manipulate its items (returning the data type, reversing the order, printing the item with the highest/lowest value, etc.).

### Day 18: 2018 February 11, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Back into Web Dev. I started two simple projects: a simple modal which shows a text-box when a button is clicked (no libraries, only Vanilla JS), and a full screen image slider (plain JS again and flexbox). 

**Thoughts:** Coding along with some amazing guys on Youtube really helps. However, in order to cement the knowledge, I'd better practice more and more every day. 

### Day 19: 2018 February 12, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I followed a video by Traversy Media (on Youtube), and I build a simple website with a parallax effect. I also added a JS function for playing a .wav file on window load. I also completed a mini course on Codeacademy about how to "animate your name". Pretty cool!

**Thoughts:** I wanna research and practice more with @media queries and animations in CSS3. Overall, I feel I'm on the right track.

### Day 20: 2018 February 14, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I started a Movie DB app which uses different functions for allowing the user to input the title, rating, duration and more of his/her favorite movies. It's a Todo list really, but it uses forEach loops (good practice for my still unrefined skills). I'm also growing the habit to refactor what I've just wrote in different ways to see if it still works. Finally, last but certainly not least, I received the notification from the Udacity team that I've been admitted to the last phase of Google Front End Development scholarship! I'm so excited about it, now it's time to get things done ;)

**Thoughts:** I want to commit fully to the scholarship program, and I also want to use all my spare time to practice and keep on going with the other courses on Udemy. I'd better establish a schedule which includes other things such as sport though: my mental health first!

### Day 21: 2018 February 15, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Yes! I've started the phase 2 of the Udacity Front End Scholarship, and I submitted my first task (an "Animal Trading Card" project). Then, I used my spare time to continue with the Colt's course. Today's topic: DOM manipulation. Finally, I threw some ideas for the Movie Database Project. 

**Thoughts:** The phase 2 is a great opportunity for reviewing my CSS knowledge and learn new tricks about how to interact with the page elements. It started today and will last until the 15th of August. No excuses!

### Day 22: 2018 February 16, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I went on with the course and learned about many functionalities of Chrome Dev Tools for emulating and testing a webpage on different devices. Then I worked on my Movie Database app and finally I looked at some new CSS3 properties.

**Thoughts:** In order to avoid the mental institution, I'd better alternate between back-end and front-end, with the latter adding, literally, some color to my mood.

### Day 23: 2018 February 17, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I watched a couple of videos and read a few articles about media queries and how to make a webpage responsive. I heard the concept "mobile first, start small" many times already, and I plan to deepen the topic. I'm also refactoring some old codes and, finally, I started a webpage where it's possible to interact with different elements and run, via JS, a few CSS tricks (such as transformations etc.). I'ts pretty funny, and I think it's a good practice playground. 

**Thoughts:** I'm gathering as much info as possible, reading as much articles as possible, and the same goes for the videos. I also bought my first e-reader ever just for the sake of studying/reading a few programming e-books I had in my laptop ("Learn python the hard way" and "JavaScript Notes for Professionals" included). 

### Day 24: 2018 February 18, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I watched a tutorial about Animate.js, and I got super interested in what I could achieve with that library. I can't wait to start messing around with it! I also studied flexbox and practiced more @media queries. Finally, I took a good look at several portfolio websites of other web devs to draw some ideas for mine. Some of them look amazing, so... it's gonna be tough!

**Thoughts:** I wanna practice my JS skills as much as possible, and the same goes for DOM manipulation and CSS grid system.

### Day 25: 2018 February 20, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Ok, so: I have to do the mock-up of a portfolio page and I don't want to use any framework like Bootstrap. It's hard, harder than I thought. Today I've watched two more tutorials about CSS Grid and its logic. I love it, I thought I could use it right after but I was wrong. I understand how it works, but things get messed up in my mind as soon as I start adding more elements (the grid-area property, in particular, gave me a nice headache). It's a long and winding road, indeed. 

**Thoughts:** Drawing sketches before even starting to code might be a good habit and I want to develop it. I must find a way to keep frustration at bay.

### Day 26: 2018 February 21, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: So, I kept on going with the scholarship and completed the section about responsiveness. Then i felt like taking a break from web dev and going back to my first passion: Python. I wrote a quick and simple program which reminds me to take a nice break every 60 minutes and which also opens a url (I used the webbrowser module) after displaying an alert box (tkinter, messagebox). I will refine the UI and explore tkinter asap.

**Thoughts:** Python is really enjoyable, and I can't wait to spend more time on it. About the portfolio page, tomorrow I will test a few solutions I planned. Fingers crossed!

### Day 27: 2018 February 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: So, I decided to build the skeleton of my portfolio page using Bootstrap for now. Later I refactor it using CSS Grid. It has a clean layout, but I plan to add modals and, possibly, a vertical sidebar with dropdowns submenus. 
I also wrote a simple program in Python which iterates through the files in a directory and modify the file name. In order to do that, I had to dive into the documentation and study a few modules. Pretty nice stuff!

**Thoughts:** I use Python 3x, and I had some errors when I tried to run my program today. After scratching my head for a while, I discovered that string translation changed from version 2, and it's now syntactically different. Python os library is pretty broad, so I'm gonna focus on the most important and useful methods. 

### Day 28: 2018 February 23, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I researched about "how to practice effetively my CSS", and I came across the post of one guy who suggested doing some mock-ups of the website wireframes posted on sites like Dribble. I never thought about that, and I think it'd be helpful in the long run. I also went on with the JS course on Udemy, and I tried to add a few effects to my portfolio page (image overlay, fade, shine, etc.). In the end I discarded them all, as I wasn't fully satisfied. 

**Thoughts:** Messing with the animations is super cool, but not useful at this stage. I'd better focus on the backbone of my webpage.

### Day 29: 2018 February 25, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I started a "Color Guessing Game" which allows me to put into practice all the stuff that I've been studying so far, from DOM manipulation, to events handling, to layout structuring, to basic JS logic. I plan to complete it within a couple of days.

**Thoughts:** I started to make good use of the simple "alarm clock" program I wrote in Python: now, every hour, the program notifies me that it's time for a breif break (up to 5 minutes). I also want to insert a logic that, after a certain amount of time (say, 4 hours), the program alerts me that I should stop for at least 15 minutes. It would be cool if it could open a video about stretching muscles after long sessions behind the computer, or some meditation/ambient music, etc.

### Day 30: 2018 February 26, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I enrolled in the Wes Bos "CSS Grid" course as I decided it just makes too much sense to favor other frameworks. I will refactor the portfolio page using it, no shortcuts, no regrets. Amen. I also resumed the course on DataQuest, and I confirmed my interest for data structures and lists manipulation. 

**Thoughts:** Ok, the new schedule is as follows: 3 hours in the morning for the Front-End, 2 hours in the afternoon for the Back-End (databases, Python, etc.). In the spare time, some related book I downloaded in my e-reader. I'm curious to see if this new strategy works better.

### Day 31: 2018 February 27, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I kept on going with Grid and watched 3 tutorials. Then I discovered Rachel Andrew's "Grid By Example" and I played around with the layouts. It's still rusty, but it's sinking in. Slowly but steady.

**Thoughts:** grid-template-areas is the key for quick designs, but it's gonna take a while to sink in. I hope I can find more online playgrounds to practice it!

### Day 32: 2018 February 28, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: More tuts about Grid, one simple "RGB Color Game" completed and several headaches. 

**Thoughts:** I read an article about JS design patterns, i.e.: the way to write JS code more efficiently. It's a brand new world really, I will keep it in mind but I'd better move on for now. 

### Day 33: 2018 February 29, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I started a course on Udacity about how to make the images responsive on any kind of device. After each lesson I practiced the new properties I came across with (i.e.: 'srcset', 'sizes', relative measuring units like vw, etc.). In the afternoon I resumed a course on Dataquest about Python and I practiced a lot. In particular, I learned how to iterate through the elements inside nested lists and how to manipulate them using the 'split()' method. Cool!

**Thoughts:** I like this new habit of splitting the day in two halves: morning dedicated to Front-End, and afternoon/late evening to Python and Back-End stuff. Side note: I plan to start learning mySQL asap!
