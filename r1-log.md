### R1D1 
Working on my final project for the Google/Udacity Front-End Development scholarshio (phase 1). The project is a Pixel Art Maker which allows the user to create a grid (canvas) and pick a color to draw on it. I'm adding new small features everyday, and I'm learning a lot. Here's the link to the project: https://codepen.io/BrandNew_12/pen/qpjZBb
